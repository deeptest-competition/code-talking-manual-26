This prevents salt crystals, for instance, from causing crusty deposits or buildup to form if the vehicle then remains stationary for a period of time. The cleaning effect of automatic car washes is usually not adequate for this in the area around the wheels.</paragraph></section></section><section id="ecls_bio_becls_a2_a106752658.SL82713995.15324" scrollable_unit="false" sl_obj_id="106752658" sl_vs_id="1964659"><title hide-online="default" hide-print="0" id="ecls_bio_becls_a2_a106752658.SL82713996.15325" toc="default">Drivetrain</title><paragraph exprid="ecls/2/106752658_SL1574148998032">With this vehicle, particular value was placed on the direct connection from engine to the drivetrain.
